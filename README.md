# popular_movies_expanded
This app shows movie posters of the top popular and highest rated movies. It pulls all data from the themoviedb.com API by using traditional RESTful JSON get requests. Later I added an implementation of OKHttp and Retrofit which streamlined some of the download processes. Clicking on a movie poster pic will give the user much more detail about the movie, such as synopsis, reviews, rating, and a list of clickable movie trailers that open in YouTube. The user can also save a favorite movie for offline use. The movie details are stored in an SQLite Database and accessed through a Content Provider. I know it's overkill for a Content Provider but I wanted to see how it works. You may need to add your own themoviedb.com API key to get the app to work (very easy to get one through themoviedb.com).

This project builds off the popular_movies app seen in this repository. When displayed on a tablet, it features a split-screen master detail layout with movie posters on the left and details on the right. Rotating the device saves important information in savedInstanceState to be revived after the rotate. This project features more movie details than the last, such as clickable movie trailers, exporting moviee trailers to email, and reviews.
