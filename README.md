# popular_movies_expanded
This app shows movie posters of the top popular and highest rated movies. It pulls all data from the themoviedb.com API by using traditional RESTful JSON requests. Later I added an implementation of OKHttp and Retrofit which streamlined some of the download processes. Clicking on a movie poster pic will give the user much more detail about the movie, such as synopsis, reviews, rating, and a list of clickable movie trailers that open in YouTube. The user can also save a favorite movie for offline use. The movie details are stored in an SQLite Database and accessed through a Content Provider. I know it's overkill for a Content Provider but I wanted to see how it works. You may need to add your own themoviedb.com API key to get the app to work (very easy to get one through themoviedb.com)
